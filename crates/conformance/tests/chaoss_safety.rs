//! The `chaoss_safety` suite: one test per scenario in `features/suites/chaoss_safety.feature`.
//!
//! Written by the Prism-DevRel builder from the app's prompt. The theorems are
//! checked by the Lean kernel when `just vv` runs `prismpm verify` on `app/`.
//! What these tests hold fixed is what each theorem is about, so a weakened
//! statement that still verifies fails the gate.
